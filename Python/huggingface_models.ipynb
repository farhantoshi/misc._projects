It also facilitates user interactions like shopping and socializing. The surface web offers quick access to information, global communication, financial management, online shopping, and entertainment like music and videos, but user identities are traceable via IP addresses. The dark web, a subset of the deep web, requires specific browsers for access and hosts inaccessible websites such as The Onion Router (Tor). It provides anonymity for accessing cybersecurity tools and cryptocurrency services but is also associated with illegal activities like child pornography, restricted content, black markets, and trading of unlawful goods. As for the user profiles, the internet caters to a diverse range of users, from those using it for socializing and entertainment to others establishing online businesses. Conversely, the dark web is frequently linked with illegal activities like fraud and trafficking, but it also harbors non-illegal users such as cybersecurity researchers and whistleblowers. The dark web is often misunderstood and judged hastily, but it is merely a tool for online anonymity. Traditional moral codes may not universally apply to the dark web, as their regulation is loose, but they still pertain to individual actions. Furthermore, while no specific laws govern its usage, traditional legal principles still apply to criminal actions on the dark web.\",\n",
